# Oxford Cambridgelytica

Oxford Cambridgelytica.  This is demonstration code to help learn about Go's differences from other languages as well as get some hands-on experience with a perceptron and a KNN algorithm usage from the GoLearn library.

## Getting Started

Download these files to corresponding folders under your Go src path.
I have not attempted "go get" with these.  Please let me know if it works or not.
Make sure to check out the demo powerpoint.

### Prerequisites

You will need to download GoLearn first and some other libraries which I will list soon.

### Installing

I will provide installation steps here.

## Running the tests

I will explain how to test the system here using the automated tests.

## Contributing

For now, I'd be excited to receive pull requests.  I don't have rules for contributing right now.
