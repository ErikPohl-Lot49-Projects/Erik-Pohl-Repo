# Something Jerry Garcia said about Django
> I mean, the combination of incredible speed – all the speed you could possibly want – but also the thing of every note have a specific personality. You don't hear it. I really haven't heard it anywhere but with Django.

# This template will be modified for my Django work

Here are some elements I expect to be able to provide, if needed:

- [ ] Apply this checklist to all new projects as step one
- [ ] A complete regression test suite in PyTest (until I can decide between that and unittest/Parameterized)
- [ ] Meaningful exceptions and exception-handling coverage.
- [ ] Thoughtful, self-documenting, variable, method, and function names.
- [ ] Adequate output to permit users to understand the results, assisting in the self-documenting nature of the code.
  - [ ] Specifically, would this benefit from comprehensive logging?
  - [ ] Would it benefit from a results page with stats to demonstrate accurate and complete results?
  - [ ] How do I want to manage output to stdout, stderr, file, etc?
  - [ ] How do comments and outputs help and assist one another without being redundant?
- [ ] Actual docstring comments at all levels of the code.
- [ ] Linting the code for PEP 8 standardization like PEP8 or Applying a PEP formatter to the code like Project Black.
- [ ] Requirements documents, user-facing documents and presentations, and other documents consistent with Agile User Stories to add value.
- [ ] Commit statements which facilitate an understanding of code history.
- [ ] Readme.md pages with more interesting usage of markdown which tell a code narrative. 
- [ ] For custom classes, create dunders as appropriate
- [ ] Make good decisions relating to
  - [ ] Exceptions versus return values
  - [ ] Using idiomatic Python versus clarity of code
  - [ ] Extend this list
  - [ ] Having functions return values -- as a default-- have a good reason not to

**_This will also serve as a template for the starting readme to do list for any new folders created under this one._**
