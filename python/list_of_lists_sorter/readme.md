# List of lists sorter class

Python offers a graceful method to sort lists of lists.

Why gild the lily?

_Because the lily is there._  And because it teaches me things about a language I love.

This class adds to the sort method the following features:
1. Define sort fields using encapsulated methods to prevent explicitly creating lambda functoons and itemgetters.
2. Gracefully handle list of lists which have a single row column header as well as headerless list of lists.
3. Select sort fields with field headers or column positions.
4. Handle strings which represent dates in the sort as dates conditionally.

# Future plans

1. Review unit test cases for completeness on 11/17.
2. Address other list of X types: dictionaries, etc. (Targeted for weekend of 11/17-- a list of dictionaries state)
3. Consider reasonable exception handling without stifling exceptions.
4. Lint the code. (Weekend of 11/17)
