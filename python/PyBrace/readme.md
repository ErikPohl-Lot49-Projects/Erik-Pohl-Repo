# PyBrace

I am mostly done with the code, but it is not ready for review.

This is a cleaned-up port of my original work in Java for a JUnit extension called Joist.

The extension allows non-techie users to build a human-language description of functionality for applications  
as the requirements are developed.




# Important disclaimer

The code here does not represent work I'd submit for production code-review.  Standards differ, and I have worked within many different
sets, helping to establish and build on them.

Here are some elements I expect to be able to provide, if needed:

a) A complete regression test suite.

b) Meaningful exceptions and exception-handling coverage.

c) Thoughtful, self-documenting, variable, method, and function names.

d) Adequate output to permit users to understand the results, assisting in the self-documenting nature of the code.

e) Actual docstring comments at all levels of the code.

f) Linting the code for PEP 8 standardization.

g) Requirements documents, user-facing documents and presentations, and other documents consistent with Agile User Stories to add value.

h) Commit statements which facilitate an understanding of code history.
