# Decorator Example: Guarantee

This decorator adds flexibility to Python function mandatory keyword argument handling.

Python does a great job without a decorator like this.

The intent of this decorator was to 
* demonstrate usage of the decorator pattern 
* add functionality to missing mandatory keyword argument exceptions
* add to the self-documenting nature of the code
* open the door for other argument validations with the same guarantee

# Future plans

- [ ] Build in other validation logic for parameters (regex, list-of-value, etc.)
- [ ] Allow for different outcomes for validation failure
- [ ] Add example code snippets
- [ ] Do the below from the disclaimer
 
# Important disclaimer

The code here does not represent work I'd submit for production code-review.  Standards differ, and I have worked within many different
sets, helping to establish and build on them.

Here are some elements I expect to be able to provide, if needed:

a) A complete regression test suite.

b) Meaningful exceptions and exception-handling coverage.

c) Thoughtful, self-documenting, variable, method, and function names.

d) Adequate output to permit users to understand the results, assisting in the self-documenting nature of the code.

e) Actual docstring comments at all levels of the code.

f) Linting the code for PEP 8 standardization.

g) Requirements documents, user-facing documents and presentations, and other documents consistent with Agile User Stories to add value.

h) Commit statements which facilitate an understanding of code history.

## Acknowledgments

* No Acknowledgements, except thanks to the interview question I received which made me want to prove this task would be trivial for me to create from scratch in a few hours for a demonstration, then refactor over time.
