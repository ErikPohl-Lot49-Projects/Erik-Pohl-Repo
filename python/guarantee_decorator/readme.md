# Guarantee Decorator

This decorator adds flexibility to Python function mandatory keyword argument handling.

![Guarantee](https://github.com/ErikPohl-Lot49-Projects/Erik-Pohl-Repo/blob/master/media/guarantee.jpg "Guarantee")

Python does a great job without a decorator like this.

The intent of this decorator was to 
* demonstrate usage of the decorator pattern 
* add functionality to missing mandatory keyword argument exceptions
* add to the self-documenting nature of the code
* open the door for other argument validations with the same guarantee

# Future plans

- [ ] Build in other validation logic for parameters (regex, list-of-value, etc.)
- [ ] Allow for different outcomes for validation failure
- [ ] Add example code snippets
- [ ] Do the below from the disclaimer
 
# Important disclaimer

The code here does not represent work I'd submit for production code-review.  Standards differ, and I have worked within many different
sets, helping to establish and build on them.

Here are some elements I expect to be able to provide, if needed:

a) A complete regression test suite.

b) Meaningful exceptions and exception-handling coverage.

c) Requirements documents, user-facing documents and presentations, and other documents consistent with Agile User Stories to add value.

## Getting Started

Download these files to corresponding folders under your Python project folders.

### Prerequisites

I will list prereqs here.

### Installing

I will provide installation steps here.

## Running the tests

I will explain how to test the system here using the automated tests.

## Contributing

For now, I'd be excited to receive pull requests.  I don't have rules for contributing right now.

## Acknowledgments

* No Acknowledgements, except thanks to the interview question I received which made me want to prove this task would be trivial for me to create from scratch in a few hours for a demonstration, then refactor over time.
