# HuffmanCoding

I wanted to build the Huffman Coding tree logic here.  This is work I did in a couple of hours.  Please see disclaimer below.
 
# Important disclaimer

The code here does not represent work I'd submit for production code-review.  Standards differ, and I have worked within many different
sets, helping to establish and build on them.

Here are some elements I expect to be able to provide, if needed:

- [ ] A complete regression test suite.
- [ ] Meaningful exceptions and exception-handling coverage.
- [ ] Thoughtful, self-documenting, variable, method, and function names.
- [ ] Adequate output to permit users to understand the results, assisting in the self-documenting nature of the code.
- [ ] Actual docstring comments at all levels of the code.
- [ ]  Linting the code for PEP 8 standardization.
- [ ] Requirements documents, user-facing documents and presentations, and other documents consistent with Agile User Stories to add value.
- [ ] Commit statements which facilitate an understanding of code history.


## Getting Started

Download these files to corresponding folders under your Python project folders to try it out.  

### Prerequisites

No prerequesites.

### Installing

Installation instructions will go here.

I will add methodology here.

## Running the tests

I will add test comments here.

## Contributing

For now, I'd be excited to receive pull requests.  I don't have rules for contributing right now.

## Improvements

- [ ] I'd like to mock some test files and their expected results.
- [ ] I'd like to utilize the Huffman Coding tree to compress files.
