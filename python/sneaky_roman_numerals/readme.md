# Countput 


This is the product of a kata performed at a coding dojo during a Boston Software Crafter's meetup last night.
The challenge was to convert roman numerals to arabic without using mathematical operations on ints (multiplication on strings was fine for repeated concatenation).
There is a ton of refactoring needed.

# Important disclaimer

The code here does not represent work I'd submit for production code-review.  Standards differ, and I have worked within many different
sets, helping to establish and build on them.

Here are some elements I expect to be able to provide, if needed:

- [ ] A complete regression test suite.
- [ ] Meaningful exceptions and exception-handling coverage.
- [ ] Adequate output to permit users to understand the results, assisting in the self-documenting nature of the code.
- [ ] Actual docstring comments at all levels of the code.
- [ ] Requirements documents, user-facing documents and presentations, and other documents consistent with Agile User Stories to add value.
