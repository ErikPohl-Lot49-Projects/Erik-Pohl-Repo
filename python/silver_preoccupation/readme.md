# silver_preoccupation

Watching a Python video, I decided it might be nice to formalize a runtime performance comparison framework of my own.
There are probably a billion out there, but this is a start, just for practice, of my own.

# Example usage

See demo usage file.

# Future work

- [ ] Implement multiprocessing 

# Important disclaimer

The code here does not represent work I'd submit for production code-review.  Standards differ, and I have worked within many different sets, helping to establish and build on them.

Here are some elements I expect to be able to provide, if needed:

- [ ] Apply this checklist to all new projects as step one
- [ ] A complete regression test suite in PyTest (until I can decide between that and unittest/Parameterized)
- [ ] Meaningful exceptions and exception-handling coverage.
- [ ] Thoughtful, self-documenting, variable, method, and function names.
- [ ] Adequate output to permit users to understand the results, assisting in the self-documenting nature of the code.
  - [ ] Specifically, would this benefit from comprehensive logging?
  - [ ] Would it benefit from a results page with stats to demonstrate accurate and complete results?
  - [ ] How do I want to manage output to stdout, stderr, file, etc?
  - [ ] How do comments and outputs help and assist one another without being redundant?
- [ ] Actual docstring comments at all levels of the code.
- [ ] Linting the code for PEP 8 standardization like PEP8 or Applying a PEP formatter to the code like Project Black.
- [ ] Requirements documents, user-facing documents and presentations, and other documents consistent with Agile User Stories to add value.
- [ ] Commit statements which facilitate an understanding of code history.
- [ ] Readme.md pages with more interesting usage of markdown which tell a code narrative. 
- [ ] For custom classes, create dunders as appropriate
- [ ] Make good decisions relating to
  - [ ] Exceptions versus return values
  - [ ] Using idiomatic Python versus clarity of code
  - [ ] Extend this list

I will provide installation steps here.

## Running the tests

I will explain how to test the system here using the automated tests.
