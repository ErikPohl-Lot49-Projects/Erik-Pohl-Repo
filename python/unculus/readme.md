# Unculus 

I don't really do holiday presents for myself.  However, I made a finite state automata, a homunculus, for myself, named Unculus.

Emerson said: *The creation of a thousand forests is in one acorn.* 

This is one acorn.

## Important disclaimer

The code here does not yet represent work I'd submit for production code-review.  Standards differ, and I have worked within many different sets, helping to establish and build on them.

Here are some elements I expect to be able to provide, if needed:

- [ ] A complete regression test suite.
- [ ] Meaningful exceptions and exception-handling coverage.
- [ ] Adequate output to permit users to understand the results, assisting in the self-documenting nature of the code.
- [ ] Requirements documents, user-facing documents and presentations, and other documents consistent with Agile User Stories to add value.
