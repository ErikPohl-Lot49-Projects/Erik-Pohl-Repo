# JSON Query Tool

This is under way and not yet ready for GitHub.
This accepts a JSON format description and a JSON expression.
Using Python's re and the JSON format description, this returns a True or a False if certain conditions are met:
a) are all query format JSON keys present?
b) do the key names and the values match regular expression definitions set up in the format description?

This can be used when querying JSON request results against a Restful API for use with a front-end query page with lots of different JSON keys which can be queried against.


# Important disclaimer

The code here does not represent work I'd submit for production code-review.  Standards differ, and I have worked within many different
sets, helping to establish and build on them.

Here are some elements I expect to be able to provide, if needed:

a) A complete regression test suite.

b) Meaningful exceptions and exception-handling coverage.

c) Thoughtful, self-documenting, variable, method, and function names.

d) Adequate output to permit users to understand the results, assisting in the self-documenting nature of the code.

e) Actual docstring comments at all levels of the code.

f) Linting the code for PEP 8 standardization.

g) Requirements documents, user-facing documents and presentations, and other documents consistent with Agile User Stories to add value.

h) Commit statements which facilitate an understanding of code history.
