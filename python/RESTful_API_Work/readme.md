# I have a long history of working on interfaces and APIs

Along with tool making, I love integrating systems.

For a long time, I was SPOC and SME ("spock and smee") for a suite of integrations from an medium-sized manufacturing firm 
to all of its external customers.

This involved:
* External customer-facing and internal customer-facing business requirements gathering and definition
* Technical requirements gathering and definition
* Team leadership of an external team of 3-5 EDI mapping and translation developers
* Software engineering to integrate the mapped and translated data into the enterprise software and out of the enterprise software
* Architecture -- put together maintainable and easily supportable architectures which reduced the time to onboard trading partners
* Project planning: Scaled and seamless migrations of the full suite of e-commerce transactions and integrations with no
service interruptions to external or internal customers.

RESTful APIs are a logical extension of my experience writing APIs and integrations/interfaces.

# This is older code for me

I hope to revisit this code to refactor / clean it up, and add to it
