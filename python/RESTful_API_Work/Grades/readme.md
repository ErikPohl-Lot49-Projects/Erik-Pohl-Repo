# Restful API TDD Example: Grades
 
In this code, I created a Restful API server and client combination to demonstrate the ability of unit tests to drive Restful API development using TDD.

** BIG IMPROVEMENTS COMING **

I will utilize my Semblance tool to provide elegant testing of this.

# Important disclaimer

The code here does not represent work I'd submit for production code-review.  Standards differ, and I have worked within many different
sets, helping to establish and build on them.

Here are some elements I expect to be able to provide, if needed:

- [ ] A complete regression test suite.
- [ ] Meaningful exceptions and exception-handling coverage.
- [ ] Thoughtful, self-documenting, variable, method, and function names.
- [ ] Adequate output to permit users to understand the results, assisting in the self-documenting nature of the code.
- [ ] Actual docstring comments at all levels of the code.
- [ ] Linting the code for PEP 8 standardization.
- [ ] Requirements documents, user-facing documents and presentations, and other documents consistent with Agile User Stories to add value.
- [ ] Commit statements which facilitate an understanding of code history.
