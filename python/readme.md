# This repo shows an evolution

I am quickly evolving my style now from "able to solve complex problems in Python reliably" more towards "writing Python I'd submit for a production code review".

I'm still learning, researching Python-particular coding patterns (even learning from anti-patterns), to refine my code style

The most representative work is recent work:

_JnesaisQ_

_list_of_xs_sorter_

I plan on building on these so they work together and so the list_of_Xs_sorter uses a design pattern to handle all of the different lists of Xs it can sort.
As I move forward, I will go back and refactor for style and clarity my former work, including adding the details below:

# Important disclaimer

The code here does not represent work I'd submit for production code-review.  Standards differ, and I have worked within many different
sets, helping to establish and build on them.

Here are some elements I expect to be able to provide, if needed:

a) A complete regression test suite.

b) Meaningful exceptions and exception-handling coverage.

c) Thoughtful, self-documenting, variable, method, and function names.

d) Adequate output to permit users to understand the results, assisting in the self-documenting nature of the code.

e) Actual docstring comments at all levels of the code.

f) Linting the code for PEP 8 standardization.

g) Requirements documents, user-facing documents and presentations, and other documents consistent with Agile User Stories to add value.

h) Commit statements which facilitate an understanding of code history.

i) Readme.md pages with more interesting usage of markdown.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown

# I know what code smells are

![Yoda doesn't like code smells](https://github.com/ErikPohl-Lot49-Projects/Erik-Pohl-Repo/blob/master/media/code_smell.jpg)

I don't like code smells.  On the job, I'm ever-vigilant about them.

Python is not my day-job.  I taught myself Python on nights and weekends because I love the language.

This is a repo I put together after a full day of work of software engineering in PL/SQL.  On weekends, it was after a full work-week in PL/SQL.  

I do this side-work because I love Python enough to spend my leisure time getting better at it.  

_Why do I have Python code up here with bad code smells?_

I want to demonstrate I can write a rough draft of Python code to do a variety of things.

Also, I am getting much better (some of this is Yoda-aged code for me!)  I do come back periodically and clean it up.

Were Python my day-job, I'd apply the same level of ever-vigilance to it, and I would address the code during a work day when I'm still fresh (have coffee / tea in me).

Some of my better work is not in this repo because it is protected by an obligation to one or more companies.

Thanks in advance for holding your nose!
