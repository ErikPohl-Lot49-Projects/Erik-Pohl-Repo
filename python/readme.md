# I know what code smells are

![Yoda doesn't like code smells](https://github.com/ErikPohl-Lot49-Projects/Erik-Pohl-Repo/blob/master/media/code_smell.jpg)

I don't like code smells.  On the job, I'm ever vigilant about them.

This is a repo I put together after a full day of work in another language, and, sometimes, after a full work-week, including the weekend, in that language.

I do this because I love it.  

_Why do I have Python code up here with bad code smells?_

Because I come back periodically and clean it up.

Also, I want you to know I can write a rough draft of Python code to do a variety of things.

Also, I am getting much better and some of this is old code.  

Were Python my day-job, I'd apply the same level of ever-vigilance to it, and I would address the code during a work day when I'm still fresh and have coffee / tea in me.


Thanks in advance for holding your nose!

# This repo shows an evolution

I am quickly evolving my style now from "able to solve complex problems in Python reliably" more towards "Python code I'd submit for a code review for production code".

I'm still learning, researching Python-particular coding patterns (even learning from anti-patterns) to refine my code style

The most representative work is recent work:

_JSONquery_

_list_of_lists_sorter_

I plan on building on these so they work together and so the list_of_lists_sorter uses the state pattern to handle dictionaries
As I move forward, I will go back and refactor for style and clarity my former work, including adding the details below:

# Important disclaimer

The code here does not represent work I'd submit for production code-review.  Standards differ, and I have worked within many different
sets, helping to establish and build on them.

Here are some elements I expect to be able to provide, if needed:

a) A complete regression test suite.

b) Meaningful exceptions and exception-handling coverage.

c) Thoughtful, self-documenting, variable, method, and function names.

d) Adequate output to permit users to understand the results, assisting in the self-documenting nature of the code.

e) Actual docstring comments at all levels of the code.

f) Linting the code for PEP 8 standardization.

g) Requirements documents, user-facing documents and presentations, and other documents consistent with Agile User Stories to add value.

h) Commit statements which facilitate an understanding of code history.

i) Readme.md pages with more interesting usage of markdown.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown
