# This repo shows an evolution

I am quickly evolving my style now from "able to solve a problem in Python" more towards "Python code I'd submit for a code review for production code".

I'm still learning, researching Python-particular coding patterns and anti-patterns to refine my code style

The most representative work is recent work:

_JSONquery_

_list_of_lists_sorter_

I plan on building on these so they work together and so the list_of_lists_sorter uses the state pattern to handle dictionaries
As I move forward, I will go back and refactor for style and clarity my former work, including adding the details below:

# Important disclaimer

The code here does not represent work I'd submit for production code-review.  Standards differ, and I have worked within many different
sets, helping to establish and build on them.

Here are some elements I expect to be able to provide, if needed:

a) A complete regression test suite.

b) Meaningful exceptions and exception-handling coverage.

c) Thoughtful, self-documenting, variable, method, and function names.

d) Adequate output to permit users to understand the results, assisting in the self-documenting nature of the code.

e) Actual docstring comments at all levels of the code.

f) Linting the code for PEP 8 standardization.

g) Requirements documents, user-facing documents and presentations, and other documents consistent with Agile User Stories to add value.

h) Commit statements which facilitate an understanding of code history.

i) Readme.md pages with more interesting usage of markdown.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown
