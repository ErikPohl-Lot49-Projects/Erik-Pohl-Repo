# List of lists sorter class
 
Python offers a graceful method to sort a list of lists.

It is so simple to use and so convenient, it seems like gilding the lily to build on top of it.

However, here it is: a list of lists sorter class.

The goals of this class are to:
1. Allow built in datatype conversions [for example, string dates into actual dates-- so the sort is done by date and not by string 
alpha-numeric sorting]
2. Provide an encapsulated interface for constructing sorts based on different fields in the list of lists
3. Allow for list of lists with headers gracefully, including setting sort fields by header field name


# Future plans

  Reluctantly get rid of getter/setter methods.  I like them.
  Refactor.
  Create regression tests to allow for TDD moving forward.
  
# Important disclaimer

The code here does not represent work I'd submit for production code-review.  Standards differ, and I have worked within many different
sets, helping to establish and build on them.

Here are some elements I expect to be able to provide, if needed:

a) A complete regression test suite.

b) Meaningful exceptions and exception-handling coverage.

c) Thoughtful, self-documenting, variable, method, and function names.

d) Adequate output to permit users to understand the results, assisting in the self-documenting nature of the code.

e) Actual docstring comments at all levels of the code.

f) Linting the code for PEP 8 standardization.

g) Requirements documents, user-facing documents and presentations, and other documents consistent with Agile User Stories to add value.

h) Commit statements which facilitate an understanding of code history.
