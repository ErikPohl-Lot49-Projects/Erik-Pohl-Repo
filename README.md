# My GitHub Repo

## A conspiracy theory
I believe Microsoft bought LinkedIn and GitHub to combine them into the ideal place to find workers and work with your portfolios and network.  This might actually succeed, despite Microsoft's [history of subpar products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death "Blue Screen of Death") and [services](https://nhlife.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/binggoogle.jpg "The best use of Bing").

Using machine learning and such, it could be a good team assembly tool for ad-hoc, contract, or permanent placements.

## Here is me doing the work for them, manually, before the AI takes over

Let me get started here with my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-pohl-0792159/ "My LinkedIn link").

## Also, in case you want to read some of my musings 

You can read some of my stories or series on [Medium](https://medium.com/@erikpohl.444 "My blog on Medium").

Here's a more recent photo of me:

I'm including Java, Go, and Kotlin work here, but my [Python](https://github.com/ErikPohl-Lot49-Projects/Erik-Pohl-Repo/tree/master/python "<3") work is the most representative of what I'm actively working on.
