# Erik Pohl's GitHub Repo

I'm a lead software engineer, working and living in the greater Boston metropolitan area.  Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with friends, hiking, studying good and bad movies, trying out new foods, creative writing, continually improving my engineering craft, and reading books (the old-fashioned kind, with spines, even!).

## Python

I'm including Java, Go, and Kotlin work here, but my [Python](https://github.com/ErikPohl-Lot49-Projects/Erik-Pohl-Repo/tree/master/python "<3") work is the most representative of what I'm actively working on.
