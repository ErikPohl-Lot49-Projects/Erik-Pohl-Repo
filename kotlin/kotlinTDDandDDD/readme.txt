# OOBattleship

This is a very geeky rewrite of the classic boardgame Battleship for three object oriented classes of battleships. 
Trust me, it is not fun to play for real.
However, as an example of using TDD and DDD to develop a Kotlin program with non-trivial rules and a finite state diagram, it works.
