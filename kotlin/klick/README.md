klick is a means of storing DDD test sets in a database with a helpful UI.

klick's logical data relationship allows you to pair test suites with functions 
in a hierarchical structure which also traces to human language business requirements, themselves in a hierarchichal structure.

This allows users to work upwards from a test suite along the technical hierarchy to more and more abstract layers of
functionality, as well as upwards from a test suite along the business requirement hierarchy all the way to the overall epic statement
for the application.
